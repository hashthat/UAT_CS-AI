    <h1>_AI__MY____AI</h1>

     <p> This is my original page that includes a little bit of CSS and HTML to creatively introduce myself!<br>
    I'm currently a UAT student, and in my first week of classes!<br>
    for my first assginment I developed this little window to show off an AI image I created through a neural network that I found through google.<br> I wanted to find a way to utilize generative AI to produce an image on a trained model that has been used by the public to see what would happen if I focused on the thought of a neural network.<br> The image below is my favorite out of all the other images I found and created which are in the repository at https://github.com/hashthat/UAT_CS-AI/tree/main/CSC102/AI_Images<br>
    I'm excited to do more generative art and discover AI as I persue my degree!<br> Given my interests in low level aspects of OS_Development and uses of the terminal<br> I have chosen to persue a degree in AI and Cyber Security, I love Devops and the Terminal.<br>
    I am currently working with MultiPass which is a tool used with Ubuntu for web development.<br> It is terminally based and I can manage multiple webpages using Docker!<br> I still have a lot to learn and this is only my second time using the VM technology<br> But the interesting thing is it is always running in the background and I can use the IP address or Multiple IP addresses for assignments as the development of my projects and classes proceed!<br>

    thanks for reading!</p>
