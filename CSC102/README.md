Currently this is a basic website hosted right here on github. A few of the tags included for the HTML development would be in the shell of what I have below as part of a class assignment at UAT.

Some of my key things in the curriculum start with the though of enginuity in programming. There's the realization that computers aren't that smart because as great as they can be, it's up to the programmer to really connect the dots and develop software that can be applied to solve real world problems. 

  

  

A basic thought with this is the coined term Heuristic problem solving which is trial and error based. 

  

this is good for the thought of procedural problem solving but what I am getting to is we are learning some basic features in web development with HTML, personalizing a webpage with CSS, and bringing the intuition through JavaScript as a language. The thought with Javascript would be the event listener for the idea of building a webpage that is interactive and comes Alive to the user. 

  

Have fun exploring my webpage as it's being developed!
